## Reflection

### 1. What went well during this unit?

[👉🏾👉🏾👉🏾 We were able to do some of the set up on github smoothly and kept in good communication on things.]

### 2. What were some challenges your group faced in this unit?

[👉🏾👉🏾👉🏾 We were unable to get through everything we had hoped in time due to being backed up with other work. We also were maybe a little unsure of what to actually get completed during this unit and the tasks we should plan out to be done during the week.]

### Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks, how would you prioritize the remaining tasks on your list?

[👉🏾👉🏾👉🏾 We were not able to get everything done, but were able to finish a lot of the setup for this week. For the remaining tasks I would prioritize being more structured in who is doing what and then trying to narrow down the actual features/tasks we are trying to accomplish]

### Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

[👉🏾👉🏾👉🏾 Right now, I would not say anything necessarily feels completely "at risk", but we will have to narrow down what are the important things to accomplish and narrow down what are things we might want to implement in addition to this (from which we can then label these more of being "at risk")..]

### 5. What additional support will you need in upcoming units as you continue to work on your final project?

[👉🏾👉🏾👉🏾 We will need to just make sure that we are finding good ways to structure what needs to get done and finding ways to allot the time to do it.]
